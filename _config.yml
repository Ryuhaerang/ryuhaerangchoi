  I am Ryuhaerang Choi, a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr">Networking & Mobile Systems Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a>.
  My research interests are designing, building, and evaluating interactive systems that support mental health and well-being by encouraging individuals‚Äô awareness and desirable behavior changes.
  My current focus is on understanding individuals' behaviors reflecting cognitive processes and mental status. I believe the knowledge informs the design of interventions and systems to alleviate tensions or challenges in mental well-being and facilitate positive behavior changes.
  <br>Research Interests: Digital Health, Positive Computing, Interaction Design

#        description: |
#          Laon is a Korean word meaning 'fun.' The Laon project was on display at Inha University's Startup Ideathon 2016 and won the **grand prize**. 
#          The theme of Laon is educational VR content to overcome cultural differences between the two Koreas after reunification. 
#          The economic and cultural gap between North and South Korea is widening long after Korea has been divided. 
#          In a survey of North Korean defectors, they revealed that they have difficulties in their daily lives despite being educated to settle well in South Korea. 
#          The number of crimes arising from the failure to adapt to the strange environment in South Korea is also increasing. 
#          Based on this situation, we predicted difficulties that would arise in social harmony and maladjustment to each other's culture after the two Koreas' reunification. 
#          To solve this problem, we also designed educational VR content that allows people from each Korea to experience each other's culture. We showcased one sample content at the contest.
