  I am Ryuhaerang Choi, a master student who aims for a system that can permeate people's daily lives and make life more prosperous. I am studying at the <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr">Networking & Mobile Systems Lab</a> at KAIST.
  People today have mobile devices all the time, so these devices are the right platforms to create the system I want to build. So, I am interested in mHCI for valuable interaction between digital devices and people, mHealth which can be an accessible medical tool, and ubiquitous sensing with mobile devices and network-connected objects around us.

        title: Ubiquotous Sensing
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Ubiquitous sensing means utilizing network-connected digital sensors in a given environment. We can detect amount of light, amplitude of sound, frequency of vibration, etc. The combination of ubiquitous sensing and ML can make objects around us intelligent.
