  I am Ryuhaerang Choi, a master student who aims for a system that can permeate people's daily lives and make life more prosperous. I am studying at the <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr">Networking & Mobile Systems Lab</a> at KAIST.
  People today have mobile devices all the time, so these devices are the right platforms to create the system I want to build. So, I am interested in ubiquitous sensing with mobile devices and network-connected objects around us, mHealth which can be an accessible medical tool, and mHCI for valuable interaction between digital devices and people.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Ubiquitous sensing means utilizing network-connected digital sensors in a given environment. We can detect amount of light, amplitude of sound, frequency of vibration, etc. The combination of ubiquitous sensing and ML can make objects around us intelligent.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
