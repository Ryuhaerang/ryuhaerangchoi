  I am Ryuhaerang Choi, a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr">Networking & Mobile Systems Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>.
  From July 2023, I have been working as a research intern at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, mentored by Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sjitiit/home">Soumyajit Chatterjee</a>, Dr. <a href="https://dispathis.com">Dimitris Spathis</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://mmalekzadeh.github.io">Mohammad Malekzadeh</a>.
  
  <br>My research centers around understanding individuals' behaviors reflecting cognitive processes and mental health. 
  I develop intervention systems to address mental health challenges based on this understanding.
  I aim to promote mental well-being and facilitate positive behavior changes through practical interventions, making a meaningful contribution towards building a healthier society.

#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          Ubiquitous sensing means utilizing network-connected digital sensors in a given environment. We can detect amount of light, amplitude of sound, frequency of vibration, etc. The combination of ubiquitous sensing and ML can make objects around us intelligent.

#        caption: Inha University's Startup Ideathon 2016 🏆
#        description: |
#          Laon is a Korean word meaning 'fun.' The Laon project was on display at Inha University's Startup Ideathon 2016 and won the **grand prize**. 
#          The theme of Laon is educational VR content to overcome cultural differences between the two Koreas after reunification. 
#          The economic and cultural gap between North and South Korea is widening long after Korea has been divided. 
#          In a survey of North Korean defectors, they revealed that they have difficulties in their daily lives despite being educated to settle well in South Korea. 
#          The number of crimes arising from the failure to adapt to the strange environment in South Korea is also increasing. 
#          Based on this situation, we predicted difficulties that would arise in social harmony and maladjustment to each other's culture after the two Koreas' reunification. 
#          To solve this problem, we also designed educational VR content that allows people from each Korea to experience each other's culture. We showcased one sample content at the contest.
