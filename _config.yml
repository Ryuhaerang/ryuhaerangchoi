  I am Ryuhaerang Choi, a Ph.D. student who aims for a system that can permeate people's daily lives and make life more prosperous. I am studying at the <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr">Networking & Mobile Systems Lab</a> at KAIST.
  People today have mobile devices all the time, so these devices are the right platforms to create the system I want to build. So, I am interested in mHCI for valuable interaction between digital devices and people, mHealth which can be an accessible medical tool, and ubiquitous sensing with mobile devices and network-connected objects around us.
  <br>Research Interests: Digital Health, Mental Wellbeing, Interaction Design

#        sub_title: mHCI
#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          Human-computer interection (HCI) studies the interaction between humans and computers including both HW and SW. One of the objectives of mHCI is to build a mobile system to improve the quality of human life.

#        description: |
#          Mobile healthcare industry has been in the limelight for years. mHealth is the term used for health-related service supported by mobile devices. The examples of mHealth applications are provision of medical information to patients, real-time monitoring of biometric signal, telemedicine, etc.

#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          Ubiquitous sensing means utilizing network-connected digital sensors in a given environment. We can detect amount of light, amplitude of sound, frequency of vibration, etc. The combination of ubiquitous sensing and ML can make objects around us intelligent.

#        description: |
#          Laon is a Korean word meaning 'fun.' The Laon project was on display at Inha University's Startup Ideathon 2016 and won the **grand prize**. 
#          The theme of Laon is educational VR content to overcome cultural differences between the two Koreas after reunification. 
#          The economic and cultural gap between North and South Korea is widening long after Korea has been divided. 
#          In a survey of North Korean defectors, they revealed that they have difficulties in their daily lives despite being educated to settle well in South Korea. 
#          The number of crimes arising from the failure to adapt to the strange environment in South Korea is also increasing. 
#          Based on this situation, we predicted difficulties that would arise in social harmony and maladjustment to each other's culture after the two Koreas' reunification. 
#          To solve this problem, we also designed educational VR content that allows people from each Korea to experience each other's culture. We showcased one sample content at the contest.
